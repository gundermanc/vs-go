// Hello-world sample in Go!
// By: Christian Gunderman

// This file's contents demonstrate the extent of GoLang support
// in Go for Visual Studio Extension.

// Package declarations can be parsed.
package main

// Functions with no parameters and no body contents can be too.
// Outlining works here, so you should see structure guides and outlining regions.
func main( /* params are not yet supported */ ) {

    /* Body is not yet supported but smart indent should work in this block */
}
